{\bf Airbnb} is a ``trusted community marketplace for people to list, discover, and book unique accommodations around the world -- online or from a mobile phone'' \citep{Airbnb14a}.

It is one of those new services that allows people to {\bf share assets} over the internet - and is part of the growing ``sharing economy''. Based on a {\bf peer-to-peer marketplace} owners with space to spare and interested {\bf people from all over the world} can directly interact with each other on the site. This allows the service to {\bf operate on a large scale} and {\bf reduce transaction costs} by doing so. Though it has just been founded in 2008 it already operates in more than 192 countries, offering places in more than 30.000 cities and processing circa 2 mio. transactions per year \citep{Economist13}.

Beside offering standard accommodations the service also provides {\bf unique, extraordinary places} to stay. Those special locations are one of the major USP of Airbnb and will be advertised as such on the homepage. Another USP is the {\bf  ease of use} of the service. As there are lot of places available there has to be an easy way for the interesting person to find what she is looking for -- based on her current location, her preferences and/or booking history.

As the booking of accommodations takes place on the internet one of the main issues they have to deal with is {\bf building a trusted relationship} between the owner and the renter of an accommodation. As people are interacting with each other directly without involving a 3$^{rd}$ party it could happen that: the {\bf quality of the accommodation} is not as announced, the booked housing is not available, the owner is not friendly and open hearted, the renter behaves rude or something gets broken down during the stay of the guest.

As the service is operating on a large, world-wide scale those problems are likely to take place frequently and they will have to {\bf manage and deal with customer complaints} and inquiries rapidly.
