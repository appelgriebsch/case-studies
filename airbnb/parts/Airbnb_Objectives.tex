\section{Objectives} % (fold)
\label{sec:objectives}
The objectives of a company can be explained top-down on three different levels: the strategic, the tactical and the operative level. The strategic level is the highest level. It contains the {\bf future strategy or vision} of the company. The tactical level on the other hand describes the actual steps in terms of {\bf application of methods, principles and other approaches} that are needed to achieve this vision. Placed on the lower end of the spectrum the operative level is describing the needs for successfully doing the {\bf day-to-day business operations} \citep{Boundless14}.
\vspace{0.2cm}

Following we will list the potential business objectives of Airbnb on each of those levels to understand what are their {\bf short-term and long-term goals} and derive from this findings what they will possibly use to measure their success. The mind maps will show the hierarchy of the objectives

\subsection{Strategic Level} % (fold)
\label{sub:strategic_lvl}
On the strategic level Airbnb tries to:
	\begin{enumerate}
    	\item establish a trusted peer-to-peer marketplace, that is
        \item available to and usable by a worldwide community, which
        \item enlist unique, attractive accommodations and
        \item provide a convenient booking experience
        \item leading to loyal, satisfied customers.
    \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tactical and Operative Level} % (fold)
\label{sub:tactical_operative_lvl}
To establish a {\bf trusted peer-to-peer (p2p) marketplace} Airbnb has to build a verified, trusted relationship between the owner and the renter, who have never met in person before.
\vspace{0.2cm}

Make the service {\bf usable and available to a worldwide community} requires not only operating the web-based system on a global scale but also to adapt to local requirements as needed e.g. tax/legal regulations and translation of the web interface. Additionally it has to make the web-based system known to a larger web community to participate on the network effect. That is the more user are using the service the more content will be available that in fact will attract additional users to sign-up.
\vspace{0.2cm}

An USP of the service is the huge list of {\bf unique, attractive accommodations} that are offered by the marketplace. Airbnb has to build up long-term partnerships with owners of extraordinary places to have them available on their platform only. Additionally those special locations have to be advertised as such and placed on an own separated place on the homepage, so that they can be found and recognized with ease. Making sure that the potential customer figures out the special features of such an accommodation at a glance will also help to promote them.
\vspace{0.2cm}

Nevertheless a large part of the user community just wants to figure out a nice place to stay in an {\bf easy, convenient way} based on user preferences or current location. Providing a mobile application is therefore a key to reach this objective. Based on the mobile device the web-based service could figure out the exact location of its user and provide a list of nearby accommodations.
